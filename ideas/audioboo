    The Audioboo plugin for iPhone is now in beta.  You can join
    the beta list by posting a message at
    http://forum.audioboo.fm/discussions/iphone-plugin

    The architecture allows for rapid inclusion of audioboo record &
    playback functionality into any app, with the extra facility of
    posting these publicly or privately.
    
    Listeners will be able to send audio direct to the station, who
    can then moderate it and choose to push it live to the app and the
    web. 
    
    Combining this with some image updates and location stuff could
    potentially make for a very simple but effective app to build for
    participants at SxSW.
